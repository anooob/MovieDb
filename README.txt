This simple application allows you to store and edit some information about movies or books into a database.

MAIN SCREEN
The main screen of the application contains a list of all the entries in the database and several ways to filter them. 

FILTERING
The textbox labeled "Search" filters the entries based on their name. 
Next to it are two textboxes labeled year. If you enter some value into these textboxes the list will only display entries published between these two years.
There are also several checkboxes to the right of the list which represent categories of the entries which should be displayed.

ADD BUTTON
Clicking on the "Add" button will bring up a screen for adding new entries into the database. You can select the type of the entry with the combobox labeled "Type". Clicking "Ok" will add entry into the database while clicking "Cancel" will bring you back to the main screen without saving the values into the database.

EDIT BUTTON
The "Edit" Button will bring up a screen similar to the Add screen but the values will be automaticaly filled out based ton the selected entry. You can now edit these values. Clicking "Ok" will save the changes while clicking "Cancel" will discard them.

REMOVE BUTTON
Clicking this button will remove the selected entry from the database.

EXIT BUTTON
This button will exit the application.

ADDING AUTHORS TO THE ENTRIES
While adding or editing entries you can associate authors with the particular entry. To do this you can click the "Add" button next to the desired author category (for example Actors). This will bring up a screen where you can see and filter all the authors in the database. To add author to the entry select the desired author and press "Ok". Pressing "Cancel" will close this screen. You can also add new authors or remove existing ones by clicking on appropriate buttons.
